# Movie App

### This movie app is a simple application that allows the user to search for movies and read an overview of each film.

### I uses an movie API that gets the movie images, titles, overviews and ratings and displays them on the web page in nice layout

### In future versions I would like to add a trailer feature, where users can click on the movie poster and be redirected to a page where they can then watch a trailer for the movie, if one is available.
